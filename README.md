# rMarkdown
slides, source code and html output for an R Markdown tutorial

Start with the slides. At some point, they will tell you to switch to example.Rmd

Since Github also uses Markdown, the default view will automatically translate some of the code and render it as html. To see the entire `.Rmd` file, click "Raw".
